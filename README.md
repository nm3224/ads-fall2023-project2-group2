# Project 2: Shiny App Development

+ **View App Here**: https://yl5487.shinyapps.io/app2/

Term: Fall 2023

+ Team #2
+ **FEMA Housing Assistance and Incident Types**:
	+ Julia Blake
	+ Noreen Mayat
	+ Yucheng Lu
	+ Arnulfo Trevino
	+ Yichuan Lin
 	+ Jingxuan Wang

+ **Project summary**:
+ In this project, we will conduct comprehensive analyses on the FEMA datasets to investigate and identify trends in the magnitude of grants awarded and the most prevalent incidents within different zip codes and states.
+ The aim of this project is to understand how disaster frequency and severity across the U.S. influence insurance premiums and to adjust risk factors accordingly.
+ The ultimate goal is to allow insurance companies to easily see which areas are severely and frequently affected by disasters, which areas need to be cautious in distributing insurance products, and which areas are suitable for raising prices.
+ In addition, by comparing government funding data, we can judge that in some states, when government funding is less than the damage caused by disasters, these states often require more insurance to protect their properties.

+ **Contribution statement**:
	+ Yichuan created the UI, created the server, rewritten code to shinnyApp's format,
	+ Yucheng made the heat maps, cleaned and combined the dataset of disaster and housing, committed files on GitHub,
	+ Jingxuan selected the dataset for the project, created plots, and designed the UI and server for the 'Frequency' section of the app,
	+ Julia kicked off EDA to determine the goal for the user and plots to create and created a couple of plots,
	+ Arnulfo and Noreen created plots, and Noreen assisted with the GitHub repo.
